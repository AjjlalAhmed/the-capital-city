              <h1>Shah Faisal Mosque</h1>
              <p>
                The Shah Faisal Mosque holds a special place in the Muslim
                community of Pakistan due to its ties with Saudi Arabia (the
                mosque was named after one of the kingdom’s monarchs). It can
                accommodate over 100,000 worshipers in its main hall and
                courtyard. Besides its religious significance, the mosque is
                famed for its architecture, which is a departure from
                traditional domes and arches. The building mimics a desert tent,
                and is situated between four pencil-like minarets. A guided tour
                of the mosque is usually an important part of the itinerary of
                tourists visiting Islamabad.

                Islamabad offers most of the major cuisines in demand in the
                region. Continental, Chinese, American, English, Italian and

                Islamabad up to Pir Sohawa in the Margalla Hills leads to Monal,
                where one can enjoy stunning views of the city while having a

              Islamabad (/ɪsˈlɑːməˌbɑːd/; Urdu: اسلام آباد‎, romanized:
              Islāmābād) is the capital city of Pakistan, and is federally
              administered as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Islamabad
              is the ninth largest city in Pakistan, while the larger
              Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area is the country's fourth
              largest with a population of about 3.1 million.[7] Built as a

              capital, Islamabad is noted for its high standards of living,[9]
              safety,[10] and abundant greenery.[11] The city's master plan,
              designed by Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis,
              divides the city into eight zones, including administrative,
              diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational sectors,
              industrial sectors, commercial areas, and rural and green areas
              which are administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation,
              supported by the Capital Development Authority. The city is known
              for the presence of several parks and forests, including the
              Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian.[12] The city is
              home to several landmarks, with the most notable one being the
              Faisal Mosque − the largest mosque in South Asia[13] and the fifth
              largest in the world. Other landmarks include the Pakistan
              National Monument and Democracy Square.[14][15][16] Islamabad is a
              Gamma + city as rated by the Globalization and World Cities
              Research Network.[17] The city has the highest cost of living in
              Pakistan, and its population is dominated by middle and upper
              middle class citizens.[9][18] The city is home to twenty
              universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam
              University, PIEAS, COMSATS University and NUST.[19] The city is
              one of the safest in Pakistan, and has an expansive RFID-enabled
              surveillance system with almost 2000 CCTV cameras.[10][20]
